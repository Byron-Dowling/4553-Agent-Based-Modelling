## Assignment Instructions:
This assignment was to essentially take the style of a prior assignment and then recreate it using NetLogo 3D.\
\
This model simulates an ocean ecosystem as there are grey agents, which represent Sharks, and then there are red agents, Red Snapper, that are the shark's prey. Agents have randomized movement in 3D space, however if a shark moves within the same region as a red snapper, the shark will eat the fish.\
\
This ABM model has two sliders to control the predator and prey population. It also has a follow function that allows you to more closely follow a random shark agent throughout the simulation, which can be stopped at your choosing. There are also options to show trails of the agent movements to get an idea of how the agents are moving through the 3D space. This can be stopped and the trails can be wiped at any time if it clutters the view too much.\
\
A fair warning to anyone that may try to run this simulation, if the blue ocean color is present, this is too much strain on a typical 8 GB RAM machine. As a result, it may be best to disable color patches in the code before running.
