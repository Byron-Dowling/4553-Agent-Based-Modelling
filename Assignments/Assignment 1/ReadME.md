## Assignment Instructions:
The goal of this assignment was to simulate an ecosystem that involved one predator, one prey, and factoring in the growth and regrowth of crops.\
\
To put a historical twist on this assignment, this model with simulate the correlation between a sparrow population, a locust population, and the rate of growth and regrowth of crops. This is to show how the sparrow population is a critical factor in controlling the locust population which in turn if left unchecked will decimate crops. This is exactly what happened in Mao Zedong's China during the "Four Pests Campaign" where the population was directed to kill nuisance sparrows which led to a dramatic increase in crop failures and ultimately led to millions of deaths.\
\
From a NetLogo persepctive, this ABM model has plenty of sliders to control variables such as regrowth rates, starting populations, rate of reproduction, energy consumption, and much more. There are also graphs and counters to help keep track of the progress of the simulation.
