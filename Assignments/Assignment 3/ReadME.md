## Assignment Instructions:
I don't remember all the specifics of this assignment instructions except that there was pretty much free reign on what we wanted to do. The only requirement was that we had to demonstrate an example of the agents becoming "hidden" when hitting a certain area of the map. A Praire Dog habitat was used as an example but instead I went with an alien invasion and the people taking cover in bunkers were my version of praire dogs "taking cover" in their burrows.\

As mentioned, this model simulates an alien invasion. Civilians and defense personel alike are moving along at random until the alien ships arrive after so many ticks which can be configured. When the aliens arrive, the user will click the screen which will alert the "agents" that they need to flee to their bunker. If aliens move over an agent before they are in the bunker, that agent is considered "abducted." As an added novelty, this can also function as a game as every click shoots missiles that if they hit the alien ships they are eliminated. Therefore if timed well with the right parameters, you can fend off the alien invasion.\
\
This ABM model has a couple of sliders to control variables such as starting number of bunkers, people, aliens, the movement and flight speed, and what percentage of agents are civillians (fleeing agents). Additionally, there are counters to help keep track of the progress of the simulation.
