## Assignment Instructions:
The goal of this assignment was to simulate different climate areas where the agents would react and move in a specific way based off what climate they are in.\
\
This model has four different climates with the desert (yellow) region being a region where agent movement speed increases and the direction of the movement is oriented to escape the "desert" as quickly as possible. If too much time is spent in the heat, the tolerance decreases. If tolerance reaches zero, the agent will die.
\
This ABM model has a couple of sliders to control variables such as starting number of turtles (agents), scene objects (for aesthetics), starting movement speed, and heat tolerance level. There are also graphs and counters to help keep track of the progress of the simulation.
